Instructions to execute the code:

1. Open the naive.py file and edit the input dataset path (posReview.csv, negReview.csv). 
2. Execute naive.py to view the results.
3. Open the rnn.py file and edit the paths of wordsList.npy, wordVectors.npy, posReview, negReview, files to execute entire code.
4. In order to save the time, we already created id matrix required for dataset in rnn.py
5. To use the id matrix, edit the path of id matrix and skip the code from 38 line to 74 line.
