CSCI 59000 BIG DATA ANALYTICS PROJECT

## Description

* Programmed a XML parser in python using xml.etree.ElementTree package
* Text data is Pre-processed by removing special characters 
* Word embeddings of text are created using Word2Vec tool and tokenized.
* A deep learning model is created using TensorFlow framework by implementing Long-short term memory (LSTM) based Recurrent neural networks.
* Bigrams are created for the text after undergoing pre-processing, which includes removing stop words and stemming.
* Na√Øve-bayes classification model is built using Bigrams and nltk package.
* Performance analysis of both models is done by drawing ROC curves, by comparing accuracies, and Area Under Curve.

## Results

Predictive Model | Accuracy
------------ | ------------- 
Naive Bayes Classification | 68.5
RNN using LSTM | 70.83
Naive Bayes Classification with Bigrams | 74.4

**Naive Bayes Classification with Bigrams showed higest acuracy using nltk**
